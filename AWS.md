Definition: What is a Service Account in AWS?
A Service Account in AWS is usually one of the following:

Type	Description
IAM Role	Preferred approach. An AWS identity with permissions that can be assumed by trusted entities (e.g., Lambda functions, EC2 instances, ECS tasks, or even other AWS accounts).
IAM User	An AWS identity with long-term credentials. Often used when the service is external and cannot assume a role. Not recommended for new architectures due to security concerns.

✅ How It Relates to AWS Organizations
AWS Organizations allows you to manage multiple AWS accounts centrally.

A Service Account (IAM Role/User) exists inside a specific AWS account.

These service accounts can be used across the organization, e.g., via Cross-Account IAM Role Assumption.

So yes — a service account can be part of an AWS Organization, as it resides within an account that is a member of the Org.
